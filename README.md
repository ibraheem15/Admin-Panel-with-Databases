React Joyride has been integrated to offer a guided tour for smooth onboarding and to assist users in understanding the application's functionalities quickly.

## Features

- Admin dashboard with category and product management.
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for categories and products.
- Integration with Firebase as a backup database for enhanced data security.
- Onboarding guide powered by React Joyride to assist users in navigating the admin panel.
- Scalable and maintainable codebase with Next.js and PHP.
